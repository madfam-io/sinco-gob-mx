# SINCO Talent Intelligence – Productization & Execution Plan

Owner: EduConsultor Labs
Date: 2025-08-02
Status: Draft (v0.1)

## Vision
Deliver a talent intelligence platform for HR to benchmark occupations, design roles, set compensation bands, and forecast hiring, built on SINCO plus enriched labor market data.

## Personas & JTBD
- HR Business Partner: advise org design, talent strategies
- Talent Acquisition Lead: plan pipelines, reduce time-to-fill
- Compensation & Benefits: set/adjust comp bands, control budget variance
- Executives: monitor market dynamics, allocate headcount

## Modules (Phase 1–3)
1) Org Design
- Occupation mapping to internal job architecture
- Division -> Role -> Level hierarchy, skills & proficiency

2) Compensation
- Market benchmarks (percentiles, locality indices)
- Compensation band generator and simulator

3) Labor Supply
- Role scarcity, demand trends, education output
- Time-to-fill and acceptance probability forecasts

4) Hiring Pipeline
- Target profiles, sourcing mix, interview funnel health
- Alerts on hot roles and market shifts

5) Skills Heatmap
- Role-to-skill taxonomy, gap analysis, mobility suggestions

## Data Strategy
- Sources: SINCO, job postings, salary surveys, CPI, education, turnover
- Standardization: occupation-to-job mapping, skills taxonomy
- Governance: lineage, versioned datasets, methodology notes, confidence intervals

## UX Roadmap (90 days)
- 0–30d (M1): saved views, export (PDF/CSV), alerts MVP, role search with synonyms, comp band generator v1
- 31–60d (M2): skills taxonomy integration, locality indices, forecasting v1, SSO, audit logs
- 61–90d (M3): peer-group analytics, internal mobility insights, public/private benchmarks, API for HRIS/ATS

## Technical Roadmap
- Frontend: continue static SPA; progressively enhance with modules; keyboard/a11y-first; mobile responsive
- Backend (Phase 2): lightweight API for enrichment & forecasting; Python jobs for data ingestion; Postgres + object storage
- Integrations: HRIS/ATS (Workday, SAP SF, Greenhouse, Lever); BI connectors; Slack/Teams alerts
- Security: hardened CSP/headers; access control; audit logging; SSO (SAML/OIDC)

## Analytics & ML
- Forecast models: demand, time-to-fill, salary drift
- Skills gap & mobility recommendations
- Cohort benchmarks (industry/region/peer group)

## GTM & Pricing
- Tiers: Starter (benchmarking), Pro (forecasting + alerts), Enterprise (integrations + governance)
- Land-and-expand motion with onboarding & advisory

## Success Metrics
- Time-to-fill reduction, offer acceptance uplift, comp band alignment, budget variance, attrition on hot roles, HM satisfaction

## Delivery Plan & Milestones
- Milestone 1 (0–30d)
  - Role mapping tool (occupation -> internal job)
  - Comp band generator v1 (percentiles + localization)
  - Saved views + exports (PDF/CSV)
  - Alerts MVP
- Milestone 2 (31–60d)
  - Skills taxonomy integration
  - Forecasting v1 (time-to-fill, acceptance)
  - Locality indices; SSO; audit logs
- Milestone 3 (61–90d)
  - Peer-group analytics; mobility insights
  - Public/private benchmark networks
  - HRIS/ATS API and BI connectors

## Work Tracking
- Use this document as the canonical plan; changes tracked via PRs.
- Maintain a CHANGELOG in this file with date, author, and summary.

## Open Risks
- Data coverage and licensing for surveys/postings
- Model accuracy and explainability requirements
- Integration complexity with HRIS/ATS
